Global neutrino analysis
========================

Disclaimer
----------

The work on GNA and GNA documentation is in full swing. Therefore not all parts of the documentation are up to date.
We can outline three parts:

1. The original documentation, starting from intro, compilation, etc. It gives an overview of the GNA and its
   application to the neutrino reactor experiments, but is a little bit outdated.
2. :ref:`reference_guide` contains description of roughly 50% of methods and classes.
3. :ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` contains detailed step-by-step explanation on how to build analysis and review the result. This is
   currently the most updated and most up-to-date part of the documentation.
