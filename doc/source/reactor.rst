Reactor experiments
======================

The Gaussian peak example we have used before is a very simple
experiment model. To include some real world experiments to analysis
it's required to implement of more complicated computational
graphs. But in the end you'll again have one (or more) observables,
which will be compared with experimental data, and a number of
parameters to be fitted or fixed.
