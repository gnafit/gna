Binding graphs via mathematical expressions (TBD)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the previous sections of the tutorial we have discussed how to use bundles to produces small computational graphs and
initialize parameters, as well to replicate them. The user is then left with a potentially large set of inputs, outputs
and parameters that should be bound together. Doing this manually may be quite a tedious job, which produces large
amount of hardly readable and poorly extensible code.

In the following section we will discuss a way to bind inputs, outputs and variable by means of indexed mathematical
expressions with a little amount of code.
