# Global Neutrino Analysis Toolkit

For installation guidelines and documentation look at `doc/`: 
> `cd doc/`

> `make latexpdf` to get the PDF file.

> `make html` to get static HTML pages, it looks better and easier to navigate.

> You can install ReadTheDocs Sphinx theme to get nicer HTML. Do the `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme` get it. Then Sphinx will automatically switch to it.

> Also you need PlantUML package to build the docs correctly `sudo -H pip install sphinxcontrib-plantuml`

> Access the docs with `firefox -new-window doc/build/html/index.html`

You will need TeX distribution and [`Sphinx`](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) installed for that.
