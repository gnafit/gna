***Global Neutrino Analysis Toolkit. Training***

We summarize here the exercises and results of their accomplishments. Here is the proposed algorithm.
1. Tasks are stored in `training/tasks` folder. 
 * There different levels, beginning from Level1 and rising up
 * Check, for example, `training/Level1/task1.md`
2. Your solution should be stored in `solutions/Level1`,  `solutions/Level2`, etc folder(s). 
 * Check, for example, `solutions/Level1/task1.dmitrynaumov.md` for the solution of `tasks/Level1/task1.md`. An examination of the solution(s) and tasks in gitlab 
   via web interface is quite convenient since one see also the pictures (png format is preferred).
3. Once the solution is checked (and if correct) the table below will be updated to acknowledge this achievement.
4. Levels correspond to the following expertise
 * Level1. Know how to use ***gna*** command line tools
 * Level2. Know how to write your own python macro which works within ***gna***. Know basic python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, etc
 * Level3. Know how to write your own C++ class which works within ***gna***. 
 * Level4. Understand methods of statistical inference: best-fit estimates of parameters, acceptance intervals
 * Level5. Know how to implement a physics case: cross-section,  oscillation probability, detector response in a robust and efficient way
5. One should get a write access to ***gna*** reaching at least the Level4.

***Level1***

| Tasks | M.Dvorak | Chuping Cheng | 
| ----- | -------- | ------------- | 
| [Task 1](tasks/Level1/task1) | [x]   | OK|

***Level2***

| Tasks | M.Dvorak | Chuping Cheng | 
| ----- | -------- | ------------- | 
| [Task 1](tasks/Level2/task1) | [x]   | OK|
