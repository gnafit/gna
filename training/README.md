***Global Neutrino Analysis Toolkit. Training***

We summarize here the exercises and results of their accomplishments. Here is the proposed algorithm.
1. Tasks are stored in `training` folder. 
 * Check, for example, `training/task1.md`
2. Your solution should be stored in `solutions` folder. 
 * Check, for example, `solutions/task1_dmitrynaumov.md` for the solution of `tasks/task1.md`. Note, that examining the solution(s) and tasks in gitlab 
   via web interface is very convenient since one see also the pictures (png format is prefered).
 * Check for example, [solution to task1](training/solutions/task1_dmitrynaumov.md)
3. Once the solution is checked (and if correct) the table below will be updated to regard this achievement.

| Tasks | M.Dvorak | Chuping Cheng | 
| ----- | -------- | ------------- | 
| [Task 1](tasks/task1) | [x]   | OK|
